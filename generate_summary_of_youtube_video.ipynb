              "\" Just four decades ago,\\nprivate car ownership was unheard of in China. For most people. In a\\ncountry where private cars still don't exist, the\\njourney to work is still by flying pigeon bicycle. And there was almost no auto\\nindustry in the country, but now it is the largest auto\\nmarket in the world by far. Some of the biggest\\nbeneficiaries of this meteoric rise were foreign\\nautomakers, including American ones. They made piles of money. But the good times have\\ncome to an end and their future in the country is\\nseriously threatened. Detroit is under pressure in\\nChina, and for the same reasons they're losing in\\nChina, they could very easily lose globally. Lured by the promise of\\naccess to a burgeoning market of at the time, more\\nthan 1 billion people, global automakers agreed to\\nstrict trade rules and taught inexperienced\\nChinese partners a lot about making cars. For a long time, it was\\nworth it. Foreign companies enjoyed\\nprestige and popularity, but Chinese firms caught up\\nfast to the point that foreign firms are now being\\npushed out. The new market isn't quite\\nlike the state owned industry, one might\\nimagine. Many top firms are\\nprivately owned. There are fewer\\nrestrictions. It's highly competitive. New models can\\ncome to market in a fraction of the time it takes\\nautomakers elsewhere in the world, and always at lower\\nprices. Increasingly, Chinese\\nconsumers prefer to buy Chinese brands, and the\\nCEOs who run these companies have close and direct\\nrelationships with their customers. It's unlikely that once\\nthey've once you've been dethroned, that you'll\\nregain any any power in the market. Despite the daunting\\ncircumstances, some say foreign firms, including\\nAmerican ones, need to double down. If you don't compete in\\nChina, then what are you going to do when China\\nshows up in your backyard? How do you know how to\\ncompete with them? You haven't even tried. China's automotive industry\\ndates back to the early 1980s. Two Chinese\\nautomakers formed joint ventures with foreign\\nmanufacturers, one with an American firm, another with\\na German one. The industry was tiny at\\nthe time. The first vehicle, the\\nVolkswagen Santana, sold 7500 units and dominated\\nthe market. The only vehicle buyers\\nwere government institutions and the like. Concept of a family car or a\\nprivate car? It wasn't. Nobody was even\\nallowed to buy cars. But reforms in the 80s and\\n90s opened the floodgates and created the 21st\\ncentury auto market recognizable today. In 1994, one of China's top\\nplanning commissions issued the policy for the\\nAutomotive Industry, also known as the 1994 Auto\\nPolicy. This rule allowed foreign\\nautomakers to take up to a 50% share. In a joint venture with any\\nChinese auto manufacturer. Foreign firms could start\\nno more than two joint ventures for any single\\ntype of vehicle. Later rules favored foreign\\nautomakers capable of producing cars that met\\nglobal quality standards from locally sourced parts. General Motors, the biggest\\nautomaker in the world at the time, entered China in\\n1997, partnering with Shanghai Automotive\\nIndustry Corporation. As China's economy\\nliberalized and grew, so did auto sales. Demand pretty much tripled\\nin the 1990s, and throughout 2000 2001, China finished\\nits negotiations to enter the WTO, and that gave more\\nsecurity and reliability predictability to foreign\\nautomakers and China really took off. Sales grew ten fold in less\\nthan ten years, and China became the world's largest\\ncar market that year. Gm used to be the poster\\nchild for an awesome US-China relationship. At one point, the CEO from\\nGM China told me, Here in China, we're making more\\nmoney than God. Things are great. Chinese people love our\\nBuicks. We're bringing Cadillac\\nsoon, and it looked like there was going to be a\\nforever annuity for the big three GM, Ford and Jeep in\\nChina. But that didn't go as\\nplanned. A quick look at the market\\nshare of international auto manufacturers in China\\nillustrates how rapidly things have changed. Gm sales in China have\\nfallen from that high water mark consistently since\\n2017. In 2023, they fell to 2.1\\nmillion lower than their US sales for the first time\\nsince 2009. Equity income from the\\ncountry GM's metric for how much it earns in its second\\nlargest market fell 34% in 2023 to $446 million. It fell 54% during the\\nfourth quarter alone. Things have been downhill\\nand accelerating downhill, so much so that GM sales\\nare down by more than 50%, Ford's down by more than\\n60%, and Jeep has actually gone bankrupt in China and\\nhad to get out. So in the last five, six\\nyears we've seen just a. Disastrous, you know,\\noutcome for the Detroit three. It's very abrupt. It's very sudden. But I think it shows the\\nthe maturity, basically of these Chinese competitors. So here is how it happened. First, Chinese cars\\nimproved by a lot. When Chinese firms first\\nstarted exporting, and they started to soon as the\\nKoreans did 30 years earlier, they didn't have\\nthe requisite quality. They failed miserably in\\nmany crash tests, particularly in Europe. And the internet was full\\nof pictures of Chinese cars crumpling like tinfoil. 510 years later. They have extremely good\\nresults in crash tests and you don't hear a word about\\nit. A lot of that. Improvement was thanks to\\nwhat Chinese automakers learned from foreign\\npartners. The whole point of the joint\\nventures was to bring them up to speed, to make sure\\nthat, uh, Chang'an that far, that Shanghai all could\\ncome up to a to a point where they could compete\\nwith basically their partners and everybody else\\nif they hadn't seen that coming, that's on them. But Bill Russo, a former\\nChrysler executive who now runs a consulting firm in\\nShanghai, sees it somewhat differently. Cross border\\ninvestments made by Chinese investors and some\\nnon-Chinese ones, were perhaps even more important\\nthan joint ventures in creating globally\\ncompetitive brands. Nanjing Automobile Group\\nbought the legendary British brand MG in 2005, and began\\nmaking cars in 2007. Geely bought Volvo from\\nFord in 2010 for $1.8 billion, and then spun out\\nthe Polestar performance line as a standalone EV\\nbrand. Geely also bought British\\nsports car maker Lotus. In 2017, American investor\\nWarren Buffett took a stake in BYD, although he has\\nsince reduced it. Some leading brands are\\nprivately owned and didn't grow out of joint ventures. Government support, of\\ncourse, played a crucial role. The country knew it\\nneeded some kind of edge on incumbents. It bet big on\\nEVs, spending an estimated ¥200 billion, which comes\\nout to about 27 billion American dollars. Byd received over $3.6\\nbillion in direct subsidies between 2018 and 2022, most\\nof it in that last year. Partly this was to combat\\nChina's intolerable air quality problems. Decades\\nof industrial development had left cities like\\nBeijing with some of the worst air pollution in the\\nworld. But the decision was also\\neconomic. The Chinese felt that they\\nhad a hard time competing with the Western, and\\nespecially Japanese companies with internal\\ncombustion engines, because it would be hard to catch\\nup. So they decided they would\\nleapfrog and go into electric vehicles. And this\\nis an area in which nobody was proficient. In 2008, at the height of\\nthe financial crisis, the Chinese government made\\nmassive investments in transportation worth about\\n$586 billion, including investments in a nationwide\\nhigh speed railway system, airports and critically,\\nhighways. The following year came tax\\ncuts on smaller cars and incentives on vehicle sales\\nin rural areas. A new policy outlined eight\\ngoals for the next two years. The plan grow car\\nproduction and sales and fund research on EVs, plug\\nins, hybrids and fuel cell vehicles. Those investments\\nhave given China a considerable leg up. A lot of the supplier base,\\nincluding critical materials, is local. Chinese firms are really\\nleading the world in battery development and battery\\nbattery production. And there's a tendency in\\nthe US, again, to think of this as all a matter of\\nsubsidies or cheap labor or lousy environmental\\ncontrols, and all those things have some role to\\nplay and particularly played a role in the past. But it\\nunderestimates the degree to which Chinese dominance is\\nbased on technical capacity. Strengths go beyond\\nbatteries and motors. Chinese firms have become\\nquite strong in software and infotainment systems, a\\nbenefit of the country's rise in the mobile phone\\nand electronics industries. Volkswagen, for example, had\\nbig problems with the software trying to hold\\ntogether its EVs, and they've looked to China to\\nhelp solve that. And I think that's a really\\nimportant part of the story that you don't hear much\\nabout. Recent entrants with\\nbackgrounds in the technology industry include\\nLi Auto, Xpeng, Nio, Xiaomi, Huawei, Baidu, Tencent and\\nAlibaba. A little bit like Tesla,\\nthey're new. They don't have the burden\\nof history. They don't have old\\nfactories to or not so many old factories to\\nreconfigure, and they have a very fast pace of\\ndevelopment. These companies view the car\\nas a technology platform for the distribution of\\nservices and the continual collection of service\\nrevenue, rather than a thing that is simply sold once\\nand then forgotten. The concept of the car as a\\nrolling smartphone or computer is already normal\\nin China. China's younger buyer base\\nprefers the highly connected products Chinese firms are\\nselling. They now are often saying\\nthat the Americans and the and the Europeans produce\\ncars that have inferior software and don't use the\\nlatest chip, and are not as much on the cutting edge. The image many non-Chinese\\nmay have of the Chinese economy is one where the\\ncentral government controls these large state owned\\nenterprises. That's partly true, but\\nthere's a lot of nuance. Three of China's major\\nautomakers are controlled by the central government in\\nBeijing, but most of them are owned by provincial or\\nmunicipal governments. A few are completely\\nprivate. It's not all operating\\nperfectly according to market principles, but if\\nyou look at the number of producers and the number of\\nmodels, it is by far the most competitive market in\\nthe world. You know, they probably will\\nsurprise a lot of people, especially given this\\nyear's, um, bloodbath. Right. Of pricing pressure,\\neconomic headwind, trying to push these vehicles out\\ninto the marketplace at lower prices, sacrificing\\nprofitability for volume. And so the foreign\\nautomakers, they have to look at this and they have\\nto balance, do I want market share or do I want\\nprofitability? The bloodbath Lei Xing is\\nspeaking of is the price war Tesla started in 2023. It began in China, but for\\nyears, an incredibly cutthroat environment has\\ndramatically accelerated the pace of vehicle development\\nin the country compared to other parts of the world. Normally, a car company\\nmight refresh or update a vehicle every 2 to 3 years\\nand then make a significant generational change every 5\\nor 6. In China, a refresh can\\nhappen within 12 months, and the company will sell it at\\na lower price than the outgoing model. And this is where kind of\\nforeign automakers, because of that legacy, they can't\\nkeep up. In addition, Elon Musk is\\nnot the only CEO who talks to customers on social\\nmedia. Chinese CEOs do, too,\\nthrough China's major platforms such as Weibo and\\nTikTok. They also solicit comment\\nthrough the apps customers use to interact with and\\nmaintain their cars. This creates tight feedback\\nloops. Michael Dunn, who for\\ndecades has been studying the auto industry in China\\nand its neighbors, says politics are also to blame. We look back at 2017. It was a year in which GM\\nand South Korea signed this agreement to supply South\\nKorea with anti-missile defense, um, facilities,\\nimportant ones. China didn't like that. And since then, we've seen\\nthe sales and market share of both the Detroit three\\nand the Korean automakers just nosedive. No one made an announcement\\nand said, hey, you guys are in trouble. You're going to\\nbe shoved out of the market. But it's pretty clear that\\n2017 was a time in which the tide turned, and the\\nusefulness of the Detroit three just sort of began to\\nfade as far as the Chinese were concerned. At the same time, a lot of\\nthe rules the Chinese government once had in\\nplace, like requiring joint ventures, have since been\\nrolled back or removed entirely. The Chinese themselves\\nlearned. They grew strong enough. So no, there's no more\\nproduction needed. Let's just have people\\ncompete. Let's have the market open\\nup. I don't want to sound overly\\ndramatic, I just want to be realistic when I say that\\nwithin the next five years, Ford, GM, Hyundai, Kia,\\nNissan more likely than not, will be out of China. Some automakers, such as\\nVolkswagen, the first foreign firm in the\\ncountry, are trying to retrench and stay in the\\ngame. They are working with local\\nfirms and trying to move faster from decision to\\nexecution. Tesla might be in better\\nshape than its Detroit rivals, at least for now. It was the first foreign\\nautomaker to be able to set up shop in China without a\\njoint venture, thanks to the liberalization of trade\\npolicies. Just over one out of every\\ntwo Teslas sold in the world is made in China. But even leaders face\\ndaunting odds. In my 27 years of living and\\nworking in China, what I've seen is a consistent\\npattern. That is, China. Invites in world class\\ncompanies learns as quickly as they can the secret\\nsuperpowers of those companies. And then\\ngradually and, you know, almost methodically sees\\nthem to the exit door. And so Tesla one day will\\nalso meet this fate. You can bank on it. Russo, the former Chrysler\\nexecutive, hopes US firms will not back out of the\\ncountry and instead invest more in local design,\\ndevelopment and production. My fear is most of the the\\nglobal auto makers have delayed the investment in\\nEV because they don't see Americans embracing the\\nelectric vehicle. He thinks foreign firms can\\nstill compete in the market and maybe even chalk up\\nsome wins. Stay in the game in the next\\n3 to 5 years. Don't give up, right? Invest and find some way to\\nintroduce those products, maybe even build them in\\nChina. If you can't find scale in\\nthe United States, and then you at least have the hedge\\non the possibility of competing with China as\\nthey go global.\""

              "\"The whole point of the joint\\nventures was to bring them up to speed, to make sure\\nthat, uh, Chang'an that far, that Shanghai all could\\ncome up to a to a point where they could compete\\nwith basically their partners and everybody else\\nif they hadn't seen that coming, that's on them. In 2008, at the height of\\nthe financial crisis, the Chinese government made\\nmassive investments in transportation worth about\\n$586 billion, including investments in a nationwide\\nhigh speed railway system, airports and critically,\\nhighways. Lured by the promise of\\naccess to a burgeoning market of at the time, more\\nthan 1 billion people, global automakers agreed to\\nstrict trade rules and taught inexperienced\\nChinese partners a lot about making cars. It's not all operating\\nperfectly according to market principles, but if\\nyou look at the number of producers and the number of\\nmodels, it is by far the most competitive market in\\nthe world. Demand pretty much tripled\\nin the 1990s, and throughout 2000 2001, China finished\\nits negotiations to enter the WTO, and that gave more\\nsecurity and reliability predictability to foreign\\nautomakers and China really took off. Cross border\\ninvestments made by Chinese investors and some\\nnon-Chinese ones, were perhaps even more important\\nthan joint ventures in creating globally\\ncompetitive brands. These companies view the car\\nas a technology platform for the distribution of\\nservices and the continual collection of service\\nrevenue, rather than a thing that is simply sold once\\nand then forgotten. The Chinese felt that they\\nhad a hard time competing with the Western, and\\nespecially Japanese companies with internal\\ncombustion engines, because it would be hard to catch\\nup. And there's a tendency in\\nthe US, again, to think of this as all a matter of\\nsubsidies or cheap labor or lousy environmental\\ncontrols, and all those things have some role to\\nplay and particularly played a role in the past. Things have been downhill\\nand accelerating downhill, so much so that GM sales\\nare down by more than 50%, Ford's down by more than\\n60%, and Jeep has actually gone bankrupt in China and\\nhad to get out. Foreign companies enjoyed\\nprestige and popularity, but Chinese firms caught up\\nfast to the point that foreign firms are now being\\npushed out. New models can\\ncome to market in a fraction of the time it takes\\nautomakers elsewhere in the world, and always at lower\\nprices. It began in China, but for\\nyears, an incredibly cutthroat environment has\\ndramatically accelerated the pace of vehicle development\\nin the country compared to other parts of the world. At the same time, a lot of\\nthe rules the Chinese government once had in\\nplace, like requiring joint ventures, have since been\\nrolled back or removed entirely. Two Chinese\\nautomakers formed joint ventures with foreign\\nmanufacturers, one with an American firm, another with\\na German one. Some automakers, such as\\nVolkswagen, the first foreign firm in the\\ncountry, are trying to retrench and stay in the\\ngame. Normally, a car company\\nmight refresh or update a vehicle every 2 to 3 years\\nand then make a significant generational change every 5\\nor 6. Russo, the former Chrysler\\nexecutive, hopes US firms will not back out of the\\ncountry and instead invest more in local design,\\ndevelopment and production. When Chinese firms first\\nstarted exporting, and they started to soon as the\\nKoreans did 30 years earlier, they didn't have\\nthe requisite quality. Chinese firms have become\\nquite strong in software and infotainment systems, a\\nbenefit of the country's rise in the mobile phone\\nand electronics industries. General Motors, the biggest\\nautomaker in the world at the time, entered China in\\n1997, partnering with Shanghai Automotive\\nIndustry Corporation. It was the first foreign\\nautomaker to be able to set up shop in China without a\\njoint venture, thanks to the liberalization of trade\\npolicies. Decades\\nof industrial development had left cities like\\nBeijing with some of the worst air pollution in the\\nworld. Three of China's major\\nautomakers are controlled by the central government in\\nBeijing, but most of them are owned by provincial or\\nmunicipal governments. But it's pretty clear that\\n2017 was a time in which the tide turned, and the\\nusefulness of the Detroit three just sort of began to\\nfade as far as the Chinese were concerned. In 1994, one of China's top\\nplanning commissions issued the policy for the\\nAutomotive Industry, also known as the 1994 Auto\\nPolicy. My fear is most of the the\\nglobal auto makers have delayed the investment in\\nEV because they don't see Americans embracing the\\nelectric vehicle. Of pricing pressure,\\neconomic headwind, trying to push these vehicles out\\ninto the marketplace at lower prices, sacrificing\\nprofitability for volume. They now are often saying\\nthat the Americans and the and the Europeans produce\\ncars that have inferior software and don't use the\\nlatest chip, and are not as much on the cutting edge. The image many non-Chinese\\nmay have of the Chinese economy is one where the\\ncentral government controls these large state owned\\nenterprises. I don't want to sound overly\\ndramatic, I just want to be realistic when I say that\\nwithin the next five years, Ford, GM, Hyundai, Kia,\\nNissan more likely than not, will be out of China. Increasingly, Chinese\\nconsumers prefer to buy Chinese brands, and the\\nCEOs who run these companies have close and direct\\nrelationships with their customers. We're bringing Cadillac\\nsoon, and it looked like there was going to be a\\nforever annuity for the big three GM, Ford and Jeep in\\nChina. It was a year in which GM\\nand South Korea signed this agreement to supply South\\nKorea with anti-missile defense, um, facilities,\\nimportant ones. Recent entrants with\\nbackgrounds in the technology industry include\\nLi Auto, Xpeng, Nio, Xiaomi, Huawei, Baidu, Tencent and\\nAlibaba. Volkswagen, for example, had\\nbig problems with the software trying to hold\\ntogether its EVs, and they've looked to China to\\nhelp solve that. They don't have old\\nfactories to or not so many old factories to\\nreconfigure, and they have a very fast pace of\\ndevelopment. Geely bought Volvo from\\nFord in 2010 for $1.8 billion, and then spun out\\nthe Polestar performance line as a standalone EV\\nbrand. If you can't find scale in\\nthe United States, and then you at least have the hedge\\non the possibility of competing with China as\\nthey go global. And there was almost no auto\\nindustry in the country, but now it is the largest auto\\nmarket in the world by far. Sales grew ten fold in less\\nthan ten years, and China became the world's largest\\ncar market that year. Later rules favored foreign\\nautomakers capable of producing cars that met\\nglobal quality standards from locally sourced parts. He thinks foreign firms can\\nstill compete in the market and maybe even chalk up\\nsome wins. Foreign firms could start\\nno more than two joint ventures for any single\\ntype of vehicle. And since then, we've seen\\nthe sales and market share of both the Detroit three\\nand the Korean automakers just nosedive. Equity income from the\\ncountry GM's metric for how much it earns in its second\\nlargest market fell 34% in 2023 to $446 million. The new market isn't quite\\nlike the state owned industry, one might\\nimagine.\""
